            <p>Hey there!</p>

            <p>We're Britt & Kyler, the founders of <a href="https://loveyourfirstyear.com" style="color: #e45e41; text-decoration: underline;">Love Your First Year</a>, and we wanted to welcome you to DateGen.</p>

            <p>As a couple, we love finding new and unique date ideas.</p>

            <p>DateGen allows you to answer a few simple questions and uses AI to generate a completely custom, completely unique date... So you can finally say "buh-bye" to boring and non-unique dates.</p>

            <p>But so many of the ideas out there were a littleâ€¦ weird? They were either way too sexual, way too expensive, or way too unrealistic.</p>

            <p>Not to mention, most dates were great for one of us but not great for the other (hello, mismatched love languages)</p>

            <p>We figured we couldn't be the only ones frustrated by the lack of great date ideas out there.</p>

            <p>We decided to build an app that would allow us to answer some questions and it would generate a completely custom date idea based on exactly what we need.</p>

            <p>To get started, you can generate 5 dates and will have access to all premium features like bookmarking and advanced options.</p>

            <p>Then, if you'd like to upgrade:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0;">
              <li>
                <a href="https://mydategen.com/upgrade" style="color: #e45e41; text-decoration: underline;">
                  - get unlimited LIFETIME access for just $39
                </a>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you have any questions, issues, or features you'd like to see us add, shoot us a DM on Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/loveyourfirstyear" style="color: #e45e41; text-decoration: underline;">@loveyourfirstyear</a> or an email at <a href="mailto:hello@loveyourfirstyear.com" style="color: #e45e41; text-decoration: underline;">hello@loveyourfirstyear.com</a></p>

            <p>Happy dating!</p>

            <p>-Britt & Kyler</p>
